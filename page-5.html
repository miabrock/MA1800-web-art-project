<!-- Link to stylesheet. I created this style.css page to design pages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the story i decided on
 a purple background and text colour because i wanted the background and text to be the same colour in different 
 shades so that it would create contrast between them. I thought this would fit well with the aesthtetic i was
 aiming to achieve. -->

<h1> Blue Door </h1>

<p1> You have chosen the blue door.
  </p1>

<!-- Next part of the story. This is where the viewer will find out what happens next in the story based on the option 
that they chose previously (the blue door). -->

  <p2> Drawn to its quiet glow, the way it seems to breathe with a promise of elsewhere. 
    As your fingertips brush the handle reality begins to ripple and soften, like paint melting from canvas. 
   </p2>

   <p3> You step through, and behind you, the archive folded into silence. 
   </p3>

   <!-- Hyperlink image to take the viewer to the next page. When they click on the image of the blue door it will take
    them to the ending that they have chosen. -->
