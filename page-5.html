<h1> Blue Door </h1>

<p1> You have chosen the blue door.
  </p1>

  <!-- next part of the story -->

  <p2> Drawn to its quiet glow, the way it seems to breathe with a promise of elsewhere. 
    As your fingertips brush the handle reality begins to ripple and soften, like paint melting from canvas. 
   </p2>

   <p3> You step through, and behind you, the archive folded into silence.
