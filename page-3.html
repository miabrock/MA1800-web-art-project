<h1> A bright orb of light emitting distorted music </h1>

<p>
     The bright orb of light drifted between the trees. It flickered once, then floated forward.
     Forward toward a path that should not exist.
</p>

<p> You follow it until it brings you down a path that leads to two doors.
      Which door will you enter?
