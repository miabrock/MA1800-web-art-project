<h1> A bright orb of light emitting distorted music </h1>

<!-- next part of the story -->

<p>
     The bright orb of light drifts between the trees. It flickers once, then floats forward.
     Forward toward a path that should not exist.
</p>

<p> 
    You follow it until it brings you down to a path that leads to two doors.
    Which door will you enter?
