<!-- Link to stylesheet. I created this style.css page to design pages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the story i decided on
 a purple background and text colour because i wanted the background and text to be the same colour in different 
 shades so that it would create contrast between them. I thought this would fit well with the aesthtetic i was
 aiming to achieve. -->

<h1> A bright orb of light emitting distorted music </h1>

<!-- Next part of the story. This is where the viewer will find out what happens next in the story based on the 
 option that they chose previously (the orb of light) and also where they will get to make their next decision. -->

<p>
     The bright orb of light drifts between the trees. It flickers once, then floats forward.
     Forward toward a path that should not exist.
</p>

<p> 
    You follow it until it brings you down to a path that leads to two doors.
    Which door will you enter?
</p>

<!-- Hyperlinks to take the viewer to the next page they choose. I wanted to make the two buttons the same so that 
 the viewer is not influenced by colour or font when making their decision. -->

<p>
    <a href="page-4.html">red door</a>  
</p>
       
<p>
    <a href="page-5.html">blue door</a>

<!-- Moving image animation. I decided to add a moving image animation to this page which is linked in the stylesheet.
 I did this to enhance the aesthetic impact and make my website more interactive. -->

<div class="image-layer">
    <img 
    src="images/orb of light.png" 
    class="bouncing-image" 
    alt="image">
</div>

<!-- Audio for effect. I added audio to this page because for this option the viewer chose to follow the orb of light
 that is emmiting distorted music. I added distorted music to this page to increase the interactive and emersive 
 experience for the viewer. -->

<audio src="audio/distorted-piano.mp3" autoplay></audio>
