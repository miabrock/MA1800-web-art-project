(A description of your project idea, context, functionality, and any challenges encountered,
A summary of the case studies from seminars that influenced your work,
A reflection on how you would extend the project with more time or resources,
A list of assets you created and those sourced online. (e.g. images, sound, video, drawings, GIFs)

My project is web artwork which is in the style of a choose your own adventure story.​ As you go through my website you have different options to click which will give you a different outcome.​ It is a story that changes every time you click. It explores how our smallest decisions shape our experience of art and narrative. It has links to media and how it can influence our decision making.​ In a world of constant scrolling, hyperlinks, and algorithmic suggestions, every click is a form of authorship. ​My web art project transforms that experience into an aesthetic journey, where the act of choosing becomes the artwork itself.​ The story unfolds differently for everyone. Each interaction alters the visuals, sounds, and narrative paths.​
I got inspiration from these case studies because I found them interesting and they are similar to what I am aiming to achieve for my own web art project:
-Art Meets Radical Openness (2020) Lost in the Garden of Clouds (Exhibition)​
-Olia Lialina (1996), My Boyfriend Came Back from the War ​

Technical issues/ limitations:
-Organisation​
-Time​
-Complexity of codes​
-Layout
