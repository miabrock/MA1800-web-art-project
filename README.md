Description of my project:
My project is web artwork which is in the style of a choose your own adventure story.​ As you go through my website you have different options to click which will give you a different outcome.​ 
It is a story that changes every time you click. It explores how our smallest decisions shape our experience of art and narrative. It has links to media and how it can influence our decision making.​ In a world of constant scrolling, hyperlinks, and algorithmic suggestions, every click is a form of authorship. 
​My web art project transforms that experience into an aesthetic journey, where the act of choosing becomes the artwork itself.​ The story unfolds differently for everyone. Each interaction alters the visuals, and narrative paths.

Challenges I encountered:
The technical issues and limitations that i have experienced are, organisation, i have found that it has been quite difficult to ​organinse my files and make sure that everything was put together correctly so that my website can run in the way that i intended.
Another one is time​, i think that learning how to manage my time when creating this projeect alongside other assignments and working has been quite difficult and a challenge that i needed to overcome. 
Complexity of the codes​, some of the different codes i used were quite difficult for me to figure out and use correctly but in the end i think it worked out.
Lastly is the layout, i struggled at the beginning to make my website layout look the way i wanted it to. It took quite a few different attempts but in the end i figured out how to do it. 
​
Case studies:
I got inspiration from these case studies because I found them interesting and they are similar to what I am aiming to achieve for my own web art project:
-Art Meets Radical Openness (2020) Lost in the Garden of Clouds (Exhibition)​
-Olia Lialina (1996), My Boyfriend Came Back from the War ​
