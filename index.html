   i wanted this index. html page and page.1 to be different from the main pages and have a different
   aesthetic and layout to give more variety and appeal. I chose these colours and fonts because i felt 
   that it fit well with the aesthetic and theme of my website. -->

      <h1>The Grove</h1>

      <!-- Opening of story. This is where I started writing the introduction to the story so that the 
       viewers wopuld understand the concept and the idea of my web.art. -->

      <p> In a fantasy realm called The Grove every decision you make is influenced by magical echoes, floating fragments of sound, image, and memory that appear in the air around you. 
        These echoes come from a mysterious source known as The Archive. 
        </p>

        <p> But something is wrong, the echoes are getting louder, more persuasive, and sometimes manipulative.
        You discover that you can see the threads connecting each echo to the choices it influences. You the set out on an adventure to try and escape The Grove and make
        it back to reality.
