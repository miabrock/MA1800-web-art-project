<h1> Welcome to The Grove</h1>

<!-- Beginning of story. This is the begining of the actual story where the viewer gets to make 
 their first choice deciding which pages of my website they will be taken to. -->

<p> You wake up in The Grove of quiet, one of the few places where the 
    echoes are faint. Suddenly you encounter a magical creature, the Whisper Owl.
    She tells you that the archive is shifting and she wants you to help investigate.

</p>

<p> She reveals two options</p>

<!-- Ordered list code for options. This shows the viewer the two options that they have to choose 
 from. -->

<ol class="choices">
  <li>A torn up letter that rewrites itself</li>
  <li>A bright orb of light emitting distorted music</li>
</ol>

<style>
.choices {
  margin-top: 5px;
  padding-left: 0;
  list-style-position: inside;
}

.choices li {
  padding: 0;
}
</style>

<p> What will you follow first? </p>

<!-- Hyperlinks to take the viewer to the next page they choose. I hyperlinked my next two pages to the different 
 options which will take the viewer to the one that they choose. I wanted to make the two buttons the same so that 
 the viewer is not influenced by colour or font when making their decision. -->

<p>
    <a href="page-2.html">The letter </a> 
    </p>

<p>
    <a href="page-3.html">The orb of light </a>
</p>

<!-- Gif pattern design. I used the same gif from the previous page so that the two first pages would have a similar 
 look before the viewers first choice. -->
