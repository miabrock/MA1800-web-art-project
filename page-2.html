<!-- Link to stylesheet. I created this style.css page to design pages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the story i decided on
 a purple background and text colour because i wanted the background and text to be the same colour in different 
 shades so that it would create contrast between them. I thought this would fit well with the aesthtetic i was
 aiming to achieve. -->

<h1> A torn up letter that rewrites itself</h1>

<!-- Next part of the story. This is where the viewer will find out what happens next in the story based on the option 
that they chose previously (the letter) and also where they will get to make their next decision. -->

 <p> 
Follow where I lead, the words write themselves, curling into existence with a soft glow. 
The left half of the letter slips from your fingers and drifts away, carried by a wind that isn't there.
 </p>

<p>
The pieces float just out of reach, guiding you through the trees and down a winding path towrds two doors.
Which door will you enter?

<!-- Hyperlinks to take the viewer to the next page they choose. I wanted to make the two buttons the same so that 
 the viewer is not influenced by colour or font when making their decision. -->

 I did this to enhance the aesthetic impact and make my website more interactive. -->
