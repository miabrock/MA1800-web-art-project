<h1> A torn up letter that rewrites itself</h1>

<!-- next part of the story -->

 <p> 
Follow where I lead, the words write themselves, curling into existence with a soft glow. 
The left half of the letter slips from your fingers and drifts away, carried by a wind that isn't there.
 </p>

<p>
The pieces float just out of reach, guiding you through the trees and down a winding path towrds two doors.
Which door will you enter?
