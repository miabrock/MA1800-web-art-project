<h1> Red Door </h1>

<p1> You have chosen the red door.
  </p1>

  <p2>
  As you cross the threshold, you feel a rush of wind and weightlessness, 
  as though the Grove is finally loosening its grip. But just as you begin to dissolve into the void beyond, 
  invisible threads snap tight around you, dragging you backward. The door slams behind you, 
  sealing shut, and you find yourself back where you started.
</p2>

<p3>
  The red door had not been an exit at all, but a test, and the Grove has chosen to keep you.
