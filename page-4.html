<!-- Link to stylesheet. I created this style.css page to design pages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the story i decided on
 a purple background and text colour because i wanted the background and text to be the same colour in different 
 shades so that it would create contrast between them. I thought this would fit well with the aesthtetic i was
 aiming to achieve. -->

<h1> Red Door </h1>

<!-- Next part of the story. This is where the viewer will find out what happens next in the story based on the option 
that they chose previously (the red door) -->

<p1> You have chosen the red door.
  </p1>

  <p2>
  As you cross the threshold, you feel a rush of wind and weightlessness, 
  as though the Grove is finally loosening its grip. But just as you begin to dissolve into the void beyond, 
  invisible threads snap tight around you, dragging you backward. The door slams behind you, 
  sealing shut, and you find yourself back where you started.
</p2>

<p3>
  The red door had not been an exit at all, but a test, and the Grove has chosen to keep you.

  <!-- Hyperlink image to take the viewer to the next page. When they click on the image of the blue door it will take
    them to the ending that they have chosen. -->
